# ESP8266-based-9-channel-Wi-Fi-relay
This simple device can make your home a little bit "smarter"<br>
This Wi-Fi relay has a nine controllable over Wi-Fi channels.<br>
The state of each channel is completely independent from one another.<br>
It's not a dimmer. Each channel has only two states "ON" and "OFF".<br>
You can expand the number of channels up to 11, but I wouldn't recommend you to do so.
